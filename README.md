This is my Nmap automation script 

You must have python and Zenmap installed for it to work (If on windows)

If you are on Linux such as ubuntu or Kali it will work just fine.

On both you might have to do windows = "pip install python-nmap"

and you might have to do windows = "pip install Pylance"

If you have issues open it in visual code studio and it will tell you what modules you are missing

Use at your will and with the proper permissions

Have fun:3

If you have any questions my discord is #the_musical_manokit
